# Architecture

ContextSmith is a multi-tenant context platform. It turns project resources into versioned, cited, agent-ready context.

## Design goals

- Keep the infrastructure boring: PostgreSQL, pgvector, Redis, RQ, FastAPI, Next.js.
- Make tenant and project boundaries part of the data model from day one.
- Treat indexed context as versioned artifacts, not mutable prompt text.
- Return citations for every retrieved answer path.
- Keep production actions outside repo agents. ContextSmith provides context; typed external tools handle mutations.
- Support multiple agent runtimes through HTTP and one central MCP endpoint.

## Data model overview

Core entities:

- `users`
- `workspaces`
- `workspace_memberships`
- `projects`
- `project_memberships`
- `resources`
- `source_snapshots`
- `chunks`
- `chunk_embeddings`
- `code_symbols`
- `index_runs`
- `query_runs`
- `retrieval_hits`
- `audit_events`

The important boundary is:

```text
workspace → project → resource → snapshot → chunk / symbol / embedding
```

Queries always resolve through workspace and project scope. Resources from another workspace/project should not appear in search, context packets, MCP calls, or usage reports.

## Resource lifecycle

A resource can be:

- created
- refreshed
- reviewed
- archived
- soft-deleted
- hard-deleted

Each refresh creates index-run state and source snapshots. Current retrieval uses current snapshots only, so old snapshots remain auditable without polluting active answers.

## Indexing path

```text
resource refresh request
        ↓
index_runs row created
        ↓
Redis/RQ job queued
        ↓
worker fetches source
        ↓
source snapshot written
        ↓
chunks written
        ↓
embeddings written
        ↓
code symbols written when applicable
        ↓
resource.current_snapshot_id updated
        ↓
index_run marked succeeded or failed
```

Document resources currently support inline markdown content. Git resources support commit-aware indexing and code symbol extraction.

## Retrieval path

ContextSmith combines multiple retrieval signals:

- lexical search over chunks
- vector search through pgvector
- deterministic code symbol search
- resource filters
- citation and usage logging

The API can return raw search results, context packets, or runtime-shaped agent context.

## Agent context path

Agent clients call:

```text
POST /workspaces/{workspace_id}/projects/{project_id}/agent-context
```

The response includes:

- runtime-specific instruction
- cited context text
- structured citations
- optional code symbols
- token budget hint

Supported runtime profiles:

- `api`
- `hermes`
- `claude`
- `codex`
- `cursor`

## MCP path

ContextSmith exposes one central MCP-style endpoint:

```text
POST /mcp/{workspace_id}/{project_id}
```

Implemented methods:

- `initialize`
- `tools/list`
- `tools/call`

Tool exposed:

- `contextsmith.get_agent_context`

This is intentionally not one MCP server per repo. A project is the boundary; a project can contain many repos and resources.

## Review and drift control

ContextSmith tracks:

- resource usage count
- retrieval hit count
- last used time
- review status
- last reviewed time
- stale-after days
- archived/deleted state
- latest index run status

This lets users clean up unused or stale context instead of blindly growing the knowledge base.

## Local development stack

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| FastAPI | API and MCP routes |
| PostgreSQL | relational state, audit, snapshots, chunks |
| pgvector | embedding storage and vector search |
| Redis | queue broker |
| RQ | background indexing workers |
| Next.js | web shell and review/search UI surface |
| Docker Compose | local real-service runtime |

## Security posture in the MVP

Current local development uses `X-User-Email` as a dev auth header. The data model already has workspace and project membership boundaries, but production deployment still needs real auth, scoped API tokens, CSRF/CORS hardening, and deployment-specific secret handling.

Non-negotiable design rule:

> ContextSmith can provide context to agents. It should not let repo agents own production mutation boundaries.

Production actions should stay behind dedicated typed MCP tools, explicit approval, and evidence/rollback workflows.

## Known hardening work

- production auth and token scopes
- scheduled refresh orchestration
- production embedding/rerank provider adapters
- richer review UI
- resource connector hardening
- public deployment docs
- observability dashboards and metrics
- hosted SaaS tenancy hardening
